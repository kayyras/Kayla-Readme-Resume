## 🧩 About Me

Vendor strategy specialist with 5+ years in high-stakes healthcare environments, managing complex Medicaid vendor programs, optimizing procurement strategies, and leading cross-functional compliance initiatives. Known for automating what others do manually, translating legal-speak into action, and making enterprise-level chaos refreshingly clear.

I thrive in remote-first orgs where ownership, structure, and impact matter — and where process is built to empower, not slow down.
